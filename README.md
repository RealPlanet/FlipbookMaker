# FlipbookMaker
A tool to create flibook sprite animations made entirely in C# NET7.0

This tool was inspired by [GlueIT](https://github.com/Kavex/GlueIT), I simply wanted to remake it in WPF for fun.

# Features
	- Add individual frames and preview them in-editor
	- Export as a single sprite atlas
	- Export a cache file which can be reimport with the same frames and settings
	- Preview single frames or the entire animation (Timing not supported)
